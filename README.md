## Project Title
### Analysis of Canadian Health Facilities - Power BI Dashboard

## Overview

This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to visually explore health facilities across Canada, using data from Statistics Canada’s Open Database of Health Facilities (ODHF). With around 9,000 entries, the dashboard provides a clear picture of where hospitals, ambulatory care services, and nursing or residential care centers are located nationwide.

### What’s Included in the Dataset?

The ODHF brings together information from several sources, offering details about each facility’s name, type, and operator, along with precise location data such as address, city, province, and geographic coordinates. The dataset covers every province and territory in Canada but excludes facilities like pharmacies, alternative medicine providers, and some specialist clinics.

- Dataset name: Open Database of Health Facilities (ODHF)
- Released: Version 1.0, April 2020
- Format: CSV file
- Source: Statistics Canada, Centre for Special Business Projects (CSBP)
- Total facilities listed: around 9,000

### Tools & Methodology

For the data that was used I make sure the information was accurate and consistent—removing duplicates, cleaning addresses, and confirming locations using Python and mapping tools.
The dashboard itself was built in Power BI, making it easy to visualize complex data and uncover patterns across the country.

### Insights & Highlights
With this dashboard, users can:
- See how different facility types are distributed by province or territory
- View health facilities on interactive maps
- Spot areas where hospitals are densely packed or where there are fewer facilities per person
- Filter results by province, city, or facility type for more detailed analysis

### What Did We Learn?

- Most hospitals are found in large cities, while nursing and ambulatory care facilities are more evenly spread out
- Some regions, especially in northern or rural areas, have noticeably fewer facilities compared to their population size—pointing to possible gaps in healthcare access
- The interactive nature of the dashboard makes data exploration intuitive, whether for research, presentations, or just getting to know Canada’s healthcare landscape

### Who is This For?

This dashboard was created as a demonstration of skills in data integration, cleaning, and visualization, serving as a portfolio piece and a resource for those interested in healthcare infrastructure.
